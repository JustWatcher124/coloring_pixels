# coloring_pixels

This project is supposed to make an AI or ML (don't know yet) to play the game [__Coloring Pixels__](https://store.steampowered.com/app/897330/Coloring_Pixels/) available on Steam. 

Basically I want to get all achievements in the game but don't want to sit there for 20 Hours clicking, instead I will spend 40 hours coding this. Worth It.
